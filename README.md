# IDPSeminars Homepage

This repository is a Jekyll-based site that hosts the IDPSeminars homepage.

It  was forked from from a template generated by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). The codebase with then edited to remove redundancy and provide some additional features more relevant for a seminar series.

The website is publically hosted at [www.idpseminars.com](http://www.idpseminars.com).

## Can I use this for my own seminar series?
Yes, please fork away, but keep all the licenses!
