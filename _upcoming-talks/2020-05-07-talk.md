## Synthetic membraneless compartments: from biology towards bioengineering
### Dr. Paolo Arosio (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

#### Professor, Biochemical Engineering
The Arosio lab combines principles of chemical engineering and biophysical methods to investigate problems of biomolecular self-assembly associated with the discovery, manufacturing and delivery of proteins for healthcare applications.

## Can phase separation explain heterochromatin properties?

### Dr. Geeta Narlikar (UCSF, USA)

#### Professor, Biochemistry And Biophysics

The Narlikar Lab studies chromatin and the many processes involved in its regulation. The lab does this using a combination of biophysical technqiues including NMR, microscopy, and cellular assays.
