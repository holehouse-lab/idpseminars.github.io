**On Thursday June 4th** Dr. Milles and Dr. Chemes will speak about studying IDPs using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, and how function is encoded into viral motifs in the E1A protein, respectively.

**Link**: Will be posted closer to the date

## Studying intrinsically disordered proteins by integrated NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies
### Dr. Sigrid Milles (Institut de Biologie Structurale Grenoble, France)

#### CNRS Researcher, Protein Dynamics and Flexibility by NMR Group 
Dr. Milles is an independent permanent researcher at the protein dynamics and flexibility by NMR group, where she uses NMR and various other biophysical techniques to study the structure, function, and dynamics of disordered proteins.

## Quantitative analysis of entropic tethering in a minimal viral model system


### Dr. Lucia Chemes (CONICET and University Nacional de San Martin, Argentina)


#### Assistant Professor, Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnologicas
The Chemes lab uses a range of experimental biophysical techniques to study the interplay between the conformational dynamics and structure of IDPs and the short linear motifs they use for biological function.
