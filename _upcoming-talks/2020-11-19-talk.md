**On Thursday Nov. 19th** Dr. Sukenik and Dr. Zeno spoke about IDRs as sensors of intracellular state and IDRs in membrane curvature sensing, respectively

## Can the cellular environment regulate disordered proteins?

### Dr. Shahar Sukenik (UC Merced)

#### Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology
The Sukenik lab combines simulations, *in vitro*, and *in vivo* experiments to examine how disordered proteins respond to their solution environment.

## The Role of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in Membrane Curvature Sensing

### Dr. Wade Zeno (University of Southern California)

#### Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science
The Zeno lab studies the interplay between disordered proteins and cellular membranes provide critical interfaces for the biochemical interactions that regulate cell behavior and function.
