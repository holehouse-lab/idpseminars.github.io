## Binding pathway of a proline-rich SH3 partner peptide from simulations and NMR	

### Dr. K. Aurelia Ball (Skidmore College)

#### Assistant Professor of Chemistry - Computational Biophysics Group
The Ball Lab studies using both simulations and NMR to understand the molecular basis of protein:protein interactions.

## The Role of LLPS in the Diverse Functions of the Nucleolus

### Dr. Richard Kriwacki (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)

#### Member, St. Jude Faculty of Structural Biology
The Kriwacki laboratory seeks to understand the molecular basis of regulation of cell division, apoptosis, and ribosome biogenesis, with special emphasis on the role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in these vital biological processes. We apply structural biology and biophysical techniques (NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, calorimetry, AUC, SAXS/SANS, single-molecule fluorescence, etc.), as well as biochemical and cell biological methods, to study the details of biomolecular mechanisms from the test tube to cells.bioinformatics.
