## The Dynamism of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in Phase Separation
### Dr. Samrat Mukhopadhyay (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, India)

#### Associate Professor, Centre for Protein Science, Design and Engineering, Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemical Sciences

Samrat Mukhopadhyay is an Associate Professor of Biology and Chemistry at IISER Mohali. His lab is interested in unveiling intriguing conformational characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). His lab uses a multidisciplinary approach and utilizes a diverse array of methodologies to study the amyloid formation and liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs associated with biological functions and human diseases.

## Understanding the functional role of the intrinsically disordered proteome
### Dr. Norman Davey (Institute of Cancer Research, UK)

#### Team Leader
Dr Daveyâ€™s research is focused on the role of short linear motifs (SLiMs) within intrinsically disordered regions in directing cell regulation. 
The lab applies evolutionary, proteomic, and genomic data to examine two major open questions about intrinsically disordered regions: (i) what are the modules that are responsible for their functionality and (ii) how do perturbations in the cell modulate the functionality of these modules.
