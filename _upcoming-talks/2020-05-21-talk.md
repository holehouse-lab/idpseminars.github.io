**On Thursday May 21st** Dr. Drummond and Dr. Boothby will speak about sequence conservation and alignment of 'unalignable' sequences and the physical basis for stress tolerance in tardigrades, respectively.

**Link**: Will be posted closer to the date

## Quantifying selection on unalignable sequences
### Dr. D. Allan Drummond (University of Chicago, USA)

#### Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
The Drummond lab combines biochemistry, biophysics and cell biology to understand the physical basis of the cellular stress response, with a particular interest in how the associated machinery is conserved.

## The role of IDPs in tardigrade desiccation tolerance


### Dr. Thomas Boothby (University of Wyoming, USA)

#### Assistant Professor, Molecular Biology
The Boothby lab is interested in the fundamental mechanisms of extreme stress tolerance. They use tardigrades (water bears) as a model system to identify and characterize novel mediators of stress tolerance. The lab's research combines molecular and cell biological techniques, with next-generation sequencing, biochemistry, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and genetic engineering.
