## Controlling Phase Behavior in Test Tubes and Cells by Artificial IDPs

### Dr. Ashutosh Chilkoti (Duke University, USA)

#### Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering
The Cholkoti group uses biomolecular engineering and biointerface science to develop  new molecular tools and technologies that borrow from molecular biology, protein engineering, polymer chemistry and surface science. These tools are then exploited for the development of applications that span the range from bioseparations, plasmonic biosensors, low-cost clinical diagnostics, and drug delivery.

## Orchestration of higher order complexes by disorder in membrane proteins

### Dr. Birthe Kragelund (University of Copenhagen, Denmark)

#### Professor of Biomolecular Sciences, Structural Biology and NMR Laboratory, Department of Biology
The major expertise of the Kragelund group is in protein interaction, structure and function relationships investigated by NMR spectroscopy as well as in biophysics. A hallmark is a strong collaborative base with biology, medicine, and industry.
