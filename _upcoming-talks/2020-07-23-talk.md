## Functional interactions of dysfunctional proteins
### Dr. Elizabeth Rhoades (University of Pennsylvania, USA)

#### Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry

Research in the Rhoades lab aims to elucidate the principles that link protein conformational change with structure-function relationships, focusing on understanding structural plasticity in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs do not form stable structures under physiological conditions; for many, function is dependent upon disorder.

## IDPs are intrinsically disordered phosphoproteins: how to study IDPs closer to native forms and conditions
### Dr. François-Xavier Theillet (CNRS - Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell, France)

#### CNRS Research
Dr. François-Xavier Theillet is an independent CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) researcher. His group develops NMR and EPR-based methods to better understand disordered proteins
