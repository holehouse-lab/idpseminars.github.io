## Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy of heterogeneous binding and aggregation of disordered proteins

### Dr. Hoi Sung Chung (National Institutes of Health)

#### Acting Section Chief, Single-Molecule Biophysics Section, Laboratory of Chemical Physics, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
The Single-Molecule Biophysics Section studies protein conformational dynamics using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. Dr. Chung's work involves the characterization of conformational diversity associated with molecular processes using both thermodynamics and kinetic approaches.

## Molten globule driven liquid-liquid phase separation at the center of viral factory assembly

### Dr. Gonzalo Prat-Gay (Fundaci√≥n Instituto Leloir, Argentina)


#### Head of laboratory of protein structure-function and engineering
The Prat-Gay lab combines biochemistry, biophysics to understand the role of disordered proteins in the context of viral function and evolution
