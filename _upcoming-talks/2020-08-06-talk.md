## Disordered proteins enable histone chaperoning on the nucleosome
### Dr. Pétur Orri Heiðarsson (University of Iceland, Iceland)

#### Associate Professor of Biochemistry, Faculty of Physical Sciences

The Heiðarsson lab uses single-molecule approaches to study IDPs. Single-molecule FRET is a sensitive molecular ruler that allows us to measure molecular distance distributions and dynamics on a broad timescale from picoseconds to hours. The lab is particularly interested in nucleic acid binding proteins, such as transcription factors, and the complex interplay between proteins and DNA.

## Single peptide affinity analysis identifies novel regions of circadian protein-protein interaction
### Dr. Jennifer Hurley (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA)

#### Richard Baruch M.D. Career Development Chair, Dept. of Biological Sciences
The Hurley lab studies the fundamental mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are an important component in understanding how organisms function within the photoperiodic world that we live in; defects in the circadian clock or disruptions in circadian rhythms are linked to a wide range of sleep, metabolic and psychological disorders in humans. The lab investigates the relationship between the core clock mechanism and the output that the clock controls using a combination of molecular genetics and biochemical techniques as well as a biostatistical/computational approach using whole genome scale data.
