## ANNOUNCEMENT: IDPSeminars has new hosts!
**A message from the IDPSeminars hosts** | *Oct 21st 2024*

We (Alex and Magnus) started IDPSeminars in May 2020. It has been a wonderful platform to host an incredible array of international science. What began as a pandemic alternative to conferences has blossomed into a consistent community with hundreds of attendees at each seminar. 

Over time, the role IDPSeminars brings has shifted. Instead of an alternative to conferences, we now have an opportunity to share IDP research with a global audience, promoting and highlighting scientists from around the world. 

As we headed towards year five, we felt it was time to hand over the reins to some new hosts. We are therefore delighted to announce that Dr. Jackie Pelham (WashU, USA) and Dr. Lucia Chemes (UNSAM, AR) have agreed to take over the hosting roles!

Jackie is an independent fellow (Cori Fellow) in the Dept. of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics at Washington University School of Medicine. The Pelham lab investigates the contribution of protein disorder to cellular spatiotemporal regulation and physiology!

Lucia is a group leader at UNSAM University, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Chemes lab studies IDP evolution and the role of protein disorder in cell signaling and pathogen hijack!

Alex and Magnus will continue to be involved in advisory roles, alternative hosting responsibilities, and technical support. However, the scientific and practical aspects of IDPSeminars is now firmly in the hands of Jackie and Lucia!

With that, we (Jackie and Lucia) are excited to announce our upcoming season of talks, which restarts on November 7th (three weeks!). 

With warmest, floppiest regards,

Lucia, Jackie, Magnus, and Alex.


# IDPSeminars
IDPSeminars is a monthly virtual seminar series that is centered around intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, our goal is to attract speakers from all walks of research. We hope to provide a regular forum in which an interdisciplinary group of scientists from around the world can present their work to a broad audience while minimizing their carbon footprint.

## Who and how?
IDPSeminars is a virtual seminar series hosted by [Jackie Pelham (Washington University School of Medicine)](https://www.jackiepelhamphd.com) and [Lucia Chemes (UNSAM)](https://investigadores.unsam.edu.ar/eng/investigador/364/Chemes-Lucia-Beatriz-). Every month, two speakers will present for around 30 minutes with 10-15 minutes of questions. The set of upcoming speakers can be found in the flyer above.

IDPSeminars was founded in May 2020 by [Magnus Kjaergaard (Aarhus University)](http://www.biophysics.dk/) and [Alex Holehouse (Washington University School of Medicine)](http://holehouse.wustl.edu), initially as a response to the pandemic. In the years that followed, the IDP community has continued to attend the seminars with great enthusiasm. As such, the seminars continued, shifting from bi-weekly to monthly. In Oct 2024, Magnus and Alex passed the reins of IDPSeminars over to Jackie and Lucia, although they are still involved in technical and advisory capacities behind the scenes. 

## When are the talks?
Seminars will be held on Thursdays at various times (depending on your timezone - summer) [last updated November 2024].

**Los Angeles**: 10:00 AM - **Chicago**: 12:00 PM  - **New York**: 1:00 PM

**London**: 6:00 PM - **Paris**: 7:00 PM - **Moscow**: 9:00 PM

**Delhi**: 11:30 PM - **Beijing**: 2:00 AM (Friday)  - **Sydney**: 5:00 AM (Friday)

## Who is this for?
Our goal is to attract a broad set of speakers to appeal to a necessarily broad audience. A short summary of each speaker's work is provided alongside their talk title. If you are interested in speaking or would like to nominate someone to speak, please contact us at [disordered.protein.seminars@gmail.com](mailto:disordered.protein.seminars@gmail.com)!
