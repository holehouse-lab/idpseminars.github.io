We are soliciting abstract submissions for the event, which will be held over Zoom on September 22nd, and provides an opportunity for anyone not in an independent group-leader position to present their work to the community.

In addition to having Zoom posters, five speakers will be selected to give short ("lightning") talks at the start of the event.

## IDPSeminars 

IDPSeminars is a bi-weekly virtual seminar series that is centered around intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, our goal is to attract speakers from all walks of research. We hope to provide a regular forum in which an interdisciplinary group of scientists from around the world can present their work to a broad audience while minimizing their carbon footprint.
