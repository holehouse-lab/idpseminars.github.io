## Do you want to present?
Are you a faculty member working (even vaguely) in the field of disordered proteins? Do you know someone who you'd like to see present? Please get in touch! Our goal is for this seminar series to be a regular fixture, providing an opportunity for people around the world to get access to cutting-edge research while keeping their carbon footprint low! We will also be soliciting speakers, but always appreciate nominations (self or otherwise!).
