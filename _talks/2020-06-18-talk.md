**On Thursday June 18th** Dr. Mittag and Dr. Barran spoke about biophysical insights into the basis of liquid-liquid phase separation and applying mass spectrometry to obtain structural information on IDPs, respectively.


## Valence and patterning of aromatic residues determine the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered prion-like domains
### Dr. Tanja Mittag (St. June Children's Research Hospital, USA)

#### Associate Member, 
Tanja Mittag, Associate Member, Structural Biology Department

The Mittag group uses a combination of biophysics, biochemistry, cell biology, and computational analysis to explore the physical basis for liquid-liquid phase separation and its link to functional compartmentalization, with a special interest in how this process goes wrong in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Resolving self-solvation versus solvation effects on the structure of disordered proteins: lessons learnt from p27 and COR15A
### Dr. Perdita Barran (University of Manchester, UK)

#### Professor, School of Chemistry and Director of the Michael Barber Centre for Collaborative Mass Spectrometry 
The Barran group have developed ion-mobility spectrometryâ€“mass spectrometry (IM-MS) instrumentation to investigate changes in protein conformation and aim to understand biological systems using mass spectrometry based techniques in conjunction with collaboration with biologists and biomedical research groups. In particular, the group has pioneered the application of IM-MS for the
