## Studying intrinsically disordered proteins by integrated NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies
### Dr. Sigrid Milles (Institut de Biologie Structurale Grenoble, France)

#### CNRS Researcher, Protein Dynamics and Flexibility by NMR Group 
The. Milles lab uses NMR and various other biophysical techniques to study the structure, function, and dynamics of disordered proteins.

## Quantitative analysis of entropic tethering in a minimal viral model system


### Dr. Lucia Chemes (CONICET and University Nacional de San Martin, Argentina)


#### Assistant Professor, Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnologicas
The Chemes lab uses a range of experimental biophysical techniques to study the interplay between the conformational dynamics and structure of IDPs and the short linear motifs they use for biological function.
