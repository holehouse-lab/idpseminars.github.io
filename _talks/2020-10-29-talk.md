**On Thursday Oct. 29th** Dr. Elbaum-Garfinkle and Dr. Nott spoke about sequence-based tuning of complex coacervates and the determinants and modulation of bimolecular condensates, respectively.

## Tunable multiphase dynamics of arginine and lysine liquid condensates	

### Dr. Shana Elbaum-Garfinke (City University of New York)

#### Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, Structural Biology Initiative at the Advanced Science Research Center
The Elbaum-Garfinkle Lab studies protein liquid phase separation and neurodegenerative aggregation using a combination of single molecule fluorescence, soft matter material science and *C. elegans* genetics.

## Modulating protein condensates

### Dr. Tim Nott (University of Oxford)

#### Group leader, Henry-Dale Wellcome Fellow, Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford
Our major aims of the Nott lab are to explain how the liquid properties of membraneless organelles provide a general organising principle in cells, and to understand why cells perform certain reactions inside them. To tackle these questions, the lab integrates cell biology, structural biology, polymer theory and bioinformatics.
