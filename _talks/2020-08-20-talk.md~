## Quantifying selection on unalignable sequences

### Dr. D. Allan Drummond (University of Chicago, USA)

#### Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
The Drummond lab combines biochemistry, biophysics and cell biology to understand the physical basis of the cellular stress response, with a particular interest in how the associated machinery is conserved.

## Phase separation in chromatin organization and transcription control

### Dr. Danifeng Cai (Johns Hopkins University, USA)

#### (currently Postdoctoral HHMI Janelia Research campus)
The Cai lab will open in spring 20201 and will focus on how biological complexity emerges and is controlled in context of transcriptional regulation.
