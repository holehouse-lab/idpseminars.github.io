**On Thursday May 7th** Dr. Arisio and Dr. Narlikar spoke about synthetic membraneless compartments and phase separation in chromatin, respectively. 


## Synthetic membraneless compartments: from biology towards bioengineering
### Dr. Paolo Arosio (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

#### Professor, Biochemical Engineering
The Arosio lab combines principles of chemical engineering and biophysical methods to investigate problems of biomolecular self-assembly associated with the discovery, manufacturing and delivery of proteins for healthcare applications. 

Given unpublished was presented, please contact Dr. Arosio directly for access to a recording of this talk.

## Can phase separation explain heterochromatin properties?

### Dr. Geeta Narlikar (UCSF, USA)

#### Professor, Biochemistry And Biophysics

The Narlikar Lab studies chromatin and the many processes involved in its regulation. The lab does this using a combination of biophysical techniques including NMR, microscopy, and cellular assays.

Given unpublished was presented no recording of this talk is provided publicly; please contact Dr. Narlikar directly for questions on this work.
